# Journey
A tool to encapsulate your entire travel experience. Before the trip, pin down your travel route, collect ideas for each leg and develop your personal intinerary. During the trip, reference your plans to make travel as easy as possible. After the trip, add photos and comments to your Journey and share with friends.
